# EArch FPGA Architecture Analysis using VPR

The `EArch.xml` FPGA architecture file was analyzed using the VPR flow. The architecture visualization, routing resources, nets, logical connections and timing reports were generated and studied.

The VPR flow was executed using the following command:

```bash
$VTR_ROOT/vpr/vpr \
$VTR_ROOT/vtr_flow/arch/timing/EArch.xml \
$VTR_ROOT/vtr_flow/benchmarks/blif/tseng.blif \
--route_chan_width 100 \
--disp on
```

---

# FPGA Architecture Visualization

The FPGA architecture generated using `EArch.xml` contains:
- Logic blocks
- Routing channels
- Switch blocks
- Interconnect resources
- FPGA grid structure


# Nets Analysis

The nets report contains:
- Source and destination nodes

---

# SDC Constraint File

## Constraint File

```tcl
create_clock -period 10 -name pclk
set_input_delay -clock pclk -max 0 [get_ports {*}]
set_output_delay -clock pclk -max 0 [get_ports {*}]
```

```bash
$VTR_ROOT/vpr/vpr \
$VTR_ROOT/vtr_flow/arch/timing/EArch.xml \
$VTR_ROOT/vtr_flow/benchmarks/blif/tseng.blif \
--route_chan_width 100 \
--sdc_file tseng.sdc \

# Setup Timing Analysis

Setup timing checks whether data reaches destination registers before the active clock edge.

After adding constraints:
- Setup slack improved
- Timing closure was achieved
- Violations were reduced

# Counter Design for VTR Flow

The following counter design was used for VTR implementation.

## Counter Verilog Code

```verilog
/*Important: Once you run ./a.out, it will keep running infinitely, because it is in an always block. You need to hit Ctrl + Z to stop it, else, the vcd will become a large file and will never end.
*/

module up_counter (
out      ,
enable   ,
clk      ,
reset
);

output [3:0] out;

input enable, clk, reset;

reg [3:0] out;

always @(posedge clk)

if (reset) begin
    out = 4'b0 ;
end

else if (enable) begin
    out = out + 1;
end

endmodule
```
